# Hi, I'm Ezra 

### About Me
I'm a recent CS grad from Williams College. I have full-stack development experience, and I'm looking for SWE work!  
Outside of coding, my interests include complex systems, cognitive science, cooking/fermentation/mycology, jazz saxophone, and urban development (transportation, green spaces, and equitable housing).
